# Executive Summary

# Software 
* Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each. 

  The Utility software performs certain tasks like virus detection, installation, data backup, deltion of unwanted files , etc. Example: Antivirus Software
 
  The Operating system software manages the hardware and create the interface between the hardware and the user. Example. Microsoft windows or the Apple IOS.
  
   The Application Software performs specific tasks such as word processing, accounting, data base management, video games or browsing the web. Example. Pandora or Office Excel. 
   
* Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example.

* In addition to the chapter use the following resource:  https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html#how-it-works
and explain the purpose of virtualization. 

  Virtualization ceates a software-based—or virtual—representation of applications, servers, storage and networks to reduce IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility.
#### Explain the following: 
* What types of problems are solved with virtualization? 

 It can solve lots of problems through different types of virtualization. With Data virtualization, the data that is spread all over can be consolidated into a single source. With Desktop virtualization, Admin can deploy simulated desktops environments to hundreds of physical machine at once. With Server virtualizations, you can get server to do more specific functions and involves partitioning it so that components can be used to serve multiple functions. Operating System virtualization is used to run Linux an Windows side by side. Lastly, with network functions virtualization, you can reduce numbers of physical components needed to create multiple independent networks. 
 
* What role does hypervisor play in virtualization? 

 A hypervisor is a form of virtualization software used in cloud hosting to divide and allocate the resources on various pieces of hardware. It allows multiple guest operating systems (GOS) to run on a single host system at the same time.
