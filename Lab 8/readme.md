# Executive Summary

 You will learn how to use Lucid Chart to make flowcharts. This lab will cover networking basics such as topology and hardware. You will learn about switch, hubs and router and which one is better. Compare different network topologies and learn when to use it. 
# LucidChart

Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that
asks for a number and then
Multiplies the number by 10
Subtracts 25 from the answer
if that answer is < 0
Displays answer is negative number
Else
Displays answer is positive number or zero

Add a textbox to the chart with your name
Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder
Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)

 I enjoyed using Lucid Chart to make a flowchart. I liked how easy it was to make it. Flowcharts are very helpful in displaying data and when I made them on the computer I had to use Word Doc and it took so long to make it. I’m happy to have found an easier way to make them. I just had to learn what types of boxes to use when which was not too hard to figure out since all the boxes have the description1 listed with them. I liked the pre-made templates.


# Networking
## Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions 

Words:
* Packet
* Packet-Switching
* IP Address
* DNS
* Protocol

Definitions to match:
* Set of rules to allow devices to communicate (Protocol)
* Unit of data (packet)
* Unique identifying number (IP)
* Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address (Packet-Switching)0o.
* Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com) (DNS)

## Network Hardware
* Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.

 The primary advantage that a switch has over a hub is the way that bandwidth is distributed. A hub that operates at 10/100 megabits per second (Mbps) must distribute the bandwidth evenly, giving 20Mbps to each node. A switch, on the other hand, delivers the full 100Mbps to each node connecting on the network.
* Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches.
 
  It is the most intelligent of the three networking devices. It is designed to understand, manipulate, and direct data packets based on their IP addresses. It connects a local area network (LANs) and wide area network (WANs) and features a dynamically updating routing table based on which they make decisions on routing data packets. When a data packet is received, it inspects the IP address and determines if the packet was meant for its network or not. If yes, then it receives the data packet, and if not then it sends it off to another network.

## Network Topology
* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.

 A single point of failure is a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. A single point of failure (SPOF) is essentially a flaw in the design, configuration, or implementation of a system, circuit, or component that poses a potential risk because it could lead to a situation in which just one malfunction or fault causes the whole system to stop working.
* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?

  An infrastructure topology is used to extend a wired LAN to include wireless devices. In this topology the devices communicate with the wired LAN via base stations called an AP, which acts as a bridge between wired and wireless LANs (WLANs). Google Nest Wi-Fi and Google Wi-Fi are mesh network Wi-Fi systems. A mesh network is a group of devices that act as a single Wi-Fi network; so there are multiple sources of Wi-Fi around your house, instead of just a single router. I think infrastructure topology would be better, so you don’t need multiple routers around the house that are costly and harder to install. However, mesh network would be faster with multiple routers.

# Conclusion

 The biggest takeaway this week was making flow chart using Lucid Chart. I enjoyed making it and having a resource to make flow chart. I learned about difference between router, hub and switch. The mesh network and infrastructure topology were new to me as well.
