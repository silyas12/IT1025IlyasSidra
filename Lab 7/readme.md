# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* Explain the difference between a raster and vector image.  
* Include examples of when each would be most appropriate 

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

## File Formats
* Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files. 

# Operating Systems

## Logo
* Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks
* Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required

  Basic pizza design, simple and sweet with 3 layers. 
  
* Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)

  The size is 5.5 KB and it opens with microsoft edge but Google Chrome would be better as it's a more robust browser.
