# Executive summary
Today we will be talking about hardware, software, data, people and process. Every single one of these are important in IT. People is just as important as the software and vice versa. Next we will talk about what defines Client-Server and some examples of it including Github. Lastly, we will touch base on Cloud Computing and the impact it has made in our lives today. 

# Information System Componentsâ€¯ 

* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.

Hardware -
Software - 
Data - 
People - 
Process - 

# Github

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture.  Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model. 

* Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use?

# Conclusion
In this section you might discuss future considerations (what you might want to learn more about), issues that you encountered (remember you may decide to post your repo link on LinkedIn or provide to a future employer so be sure to keep your discussion professional) and/or your impressions of the lab components.
