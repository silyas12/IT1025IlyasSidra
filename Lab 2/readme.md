# Executive summary
 Today we will be talking about hardware, software, data, people and process. Every single one of these are important in IT. People is just as important as the software and vice versa. Next we will talk about what defines Client-Server and some examples of it including Github. Lastly, we will touch base on Cloud Computing and the impact it has made in our lives today. 

# Information System Componentsâ€¯ 

* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.

   **Hardware** - the hardware is external part that you can see. On an ATM, it would be the screen, touchpad, card inserter, money dispenser, and much more.  
   **Software** - is what tells the hardware what to do. there are two main categories of software : Operating Systems and Application Software. Mast majority of ATMs use Operating System.  
   **Data** - is collection of facts that is used to improve the organizations performance. Data in an ATM would be analyzing the card, pin, bank, and how much money is requested to dispense and a survey to measure the satisfaction of customers.  
   **People** - people would be customers, owners, techs, programmers, of ATM. Without people, the tech is useless. You need users and creators.  
   **Process** - The process is a series of steps undertaken to achieve a desired outcome or goal. In this case, the goal is to dispense the requested money by the customer.   

# Github

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture.  Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model. 

  Client Server Architecture main function is to allow users to log in to Local Area Network (LAN) from their PC ("the client") by connecting to a central computer called a "server." Github uses this technology too. You can use Github to share with other what you have been working on with multiple users to access the same data at a same time by connecting their computer and logging in to Github. 
 
 * Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use?
    "Cloud" in Cloud Computing refers to Applications services, data, and storage located on the internet. Cloud Service providers rely on giant server farm and massive storage devices that are connected via internet. It allows users to access software and data storage services on the internet. One example would be the accesing our email through the browser or using google drive's applications. Github is also a cloud computing because we are able to access and share work to be seen and edited by others as long as we are connected to internet. Anybody from any country can access with internet.  
# Conclusion
 
 I don't know much about Computers. All of this information was super new to me, it was very intereting to know what Client-Server and Cloud Computing was since I use it everyday and to see the impact it has made in our lives. I learned how hardware, software, data, people, and process work together to achieve a main goal. All tech has these 5 things to make them effective and useful. I would love to keep learning more about computers because it has been very interesting so far.
