# Executive Summary

You will write little bit of code for web programming and learn about JSON. We will cover HTML, XML, and what W3C is. 

# Internet Programming
* Upload screenshots of your html, css and result
* Upload JSON activity

* Who was Tim Berners-Lee and why did he create the W3C?

  In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due.


* Pick a "standard" of your choice and explain why it is important.

I don't know what you mean


* What is the purpose of Hypertext Markup Language in Web Programming?

 HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the basic scripting language used by web browsers to render pages on the world wide web. HyperText allows a user to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced by that link.
* Why do we use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in Web Programming?

 CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. We can change webpage by just editing the CSS. This makes it easier for companies to make changes to their websites. 
  
* Explain how XML differs from HTML. 

   XML mainly focuses on transfer of data while HTML is focused on presentation of the data. XML is content driven whereas HTML is format driven. XML is Case sensitive while HTML is Case insensitive.

* What is the advantage of JSON over XML?

   JSON has a more compact style than XML, and it is often more readable. The lightweight approach of JSON can make significant improvements in RESTful APIs working with complex systems. Faster: The XML software parsing process can take a long time.

# Conclusion

I learned the basics of programming which was very fun. I coded a little and enjoyed that the most. I definetly want to pursue programming.
