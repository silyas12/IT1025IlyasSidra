  I chose to look into Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) Certifications. This certificate test to check your knowledge and skills required to install, configure, and troubleshoot converged local-and-wide area networks with 100 to 500 or more end devices. To get a CCNP certification, one needs to obtain a CCNA certification.
## College Certificates

   Iâ€™m currently trying to pursue the post-graduate certification in Information Technology, Programming and Development. It consists of 9 classes or 32 credit hours. It can be completed in 3 semesters with 3 classes each. This program is designed to update or enhance skills in object-oriented technologies. Students will experience the object-oriented environment of programming, database and Web technologies. This certification is my starting point and then I plan on to teach myself and practice web development for a year. I chose this because I already hold a bachelor degree and wanted a career change but without breaking the bank.

## Professional Membership

   As a women,  I would like to join ACM-W that supports, celebrate and advocates women in computing. It advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in all aspects of the computing field, providing a wide range of programs and services to ACM members and working in the larger community to advance the contributions of technical women. We need more organizations like these that would support women in IT.
# Conclusion

   I learned how many different job titles are available in IT field and the salary and job outlook is pretty good. I kinda knew this that's why I'm trying to change my field but it was still assuring. I didn't know much about the certificates since I'm more on the programming route. I was very happy to learn there's an organization looking out and supporting women in IT.
