# Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab

# Cybersecurity and Encryption

* Imagine you are part of the Amazon.com online chat. Explain how each component of the security triad would impact your job
* Identify three daily tasks that require authentication. Explain how each one could be converted to multi-factor authentication
* Explain ACL and RBAC. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
* Explain the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key
* Explain why we need public key cryptography.

## Cryptography
* Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message.
Then explain the encryption here:

  I wrote life is hard. It returned jgdc gq fypb. Here my original message shifted by two letters. Each letter applies a shift of number of leters they decide on like 3 for example 
* Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result.

  I wrote I am learning to program. I saw the frequency go up for some letters and more I wrote the frequency rose higher. 
b) Would it be different for different languages?
Yea, it would be because other languages would use letters differently. 
* What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?"
Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word.
Explain the result.

  I wrote I like it. It gave me j dclw cu and my shift word is art. So the way code works is used the order of alphabet on art. ART would be 1,18,20. So the letters would shift by 1,18,20 each time and it repeats. 

## Brute Force
* What is Brute-Force and how does it relate to Kerckhoffs's principle?
