# Executive Summary
Include your executive summary here..
 
  In this lab, you will learn about ACM and AUP. The differences between the two and how they affect you in the tech world. You will learn about the importance of copyright your work and how trademark can help your business grow. You will learn about different types of policies that protect your privacy such as HIPPA. Lastly, you will learn about what makes up a URL. It would be broken down into scheme, domain, top level domain, parameter, anchor, and more. 

# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.

 The ACM Code of Ethics is a collection of principles and guidelines designed to help computing professionals make ethically responsible decisions in professional practice. It translates broad ethical principles into concrete statements about professional conduct. The Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way. 
* Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.) 

  An acceptable use policy (AUP), acceptable usage policy or fair use policy is a set of rules applied by the owner, creator or administrator of a computer network website, or service. That restricts the ways in which the network, website or system may be used and sets guidelines as to how it should be used. The biggest difference is that AUP is policy for employees’ actions.
* Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP.  Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.) 

  I read AUP policy for Digital Realty. The policy was very detailed and covered what is considered illegal activity, spoofing, and fraud. It talked about when the law enforcement would be involved. Lastly, it included Customers and Users Responsibility.

## Intellectual Property
* From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO.  What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 

WIPO was created to promote and protect intellectual property (IP) across the world by cooperating with countries as well as international organizations. 
* Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created. 
  
   Technically, any work that can be copyrighted is copyrighted as soon as that work is fixed in a tangible medium. However, copyright registration provides important benefits, such as the ability to assign the copyrighted work and to sue for statutory damages, attorney's fees and court costs. In order to obtain copyright registration, you must create a work that is eligible for protection and register with the U.S. Copyright Office. Registration is particularly important for small businesses, as the right to assign your copyrighted work could benefit your business in the instance of a merger or corporate takeover. It’s very important to copyright so nobody steals your work and to protect yourself from getting sued for stealing someone else work. 
* If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property. 

  A trademark most often protects IP associated with companies, such as a word, phrase, symbol or design used to identify and promote products or services. Companies may also use a service mark, which protects their services in the same way trademarks protect their goods. Trademarks can help a business to differentiate what they make, do and sell from their competitors’ offerings. Businesses can become more recognizable and attractive to consumers through the use of their exclusive names, logos and other branding elements, because no other businesses will be permitted to use such elements if they are protected by trademarks.
 
## Information Collection
* Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet. 

  FERPA is federal legislation that allows parents the right to access their child’s education record, the right to have the education record amended, and the right to have some control over the disclosure of their child’s personally identifiable information (PII) from the education record. FERPA law applies to all educational institutions that receive federal funds.
The COPPA Rule spells out what operators of commercial websites and online services must do to protect the privacy and safety of children online and imposes certain requirements on those individuals that have access to student information.
A major goal of the HIPAA is to assure that individuals’ health information is properly protected while allowing the flow of health information needed to provide and promote high quality health care and to protect the public's health and well-being. The Rule strikes a balance that permits important uses of information, while protecting the privacy of people who seek care and healing.


# URLs and File Paths
* Match the following terms / definitions under the heading and explain how they are related by providing an example of all of the pieces of a URL: 
Terms: scheme, domain, top level domain, default page, parameters, anchor 
Definitions/examples: .edu, no file path provided, result of search, https, www.amazon.com, specific location on a page. 

 Scheme- https
Domain- www.amazon.com
Top level domain- .edu
Default page- no file path provided
Parameters- result of search
Anchor- specific location on a page

* What is your understanding of difference between Absolute and Relative File Paths. What would you use in your website? Why?

  A path is either relative or absolute. An absolute path always contains the root element and the complete directory list required to locate the file. For example, /home/sally/statusReport is an absolute path. All of the information needed to locate the file is contained in the path string.
A relative path needs to be combined with another path in order to access a file. For example, joe/foo is a relative path. Without more information, a program cannot reliably locate the joe/foo directory in the file system. I would use Absolute links because they are good when you want to send the user to a page that is outside of your server. Links like this can be searched from anywhere on the Internet, not just on one site.

* Explain the purpose and use of file compression.

File compression is a data compression method in which the logical size of a file is reduced to save disk space for easier and faster transmission over a network or the Internet. It enables the creation of a version of one or more files with the same data at a size substantially smaller than the original file.

# Conclusion
Include your conclusion here...

  It was interesting to learn what makes up a URL. I always wondered what https stood for and other information on the URL. I also learned how relative path is better for providing a URL to outside who don’t have access to files on your desktop. It was fun to read an AUP policy from a real company. I got an idea of what is included and what  I would have to watch out for in the real world.
