# Executive Summary
Include your executive summary here...

  This week would cover different versions of IP. The most used IPv4 and the newest version IPv6. You will learn the importance of ICANN. Next, we will cover about TCP and IP once again and how client server module plays an important role between them. Lastly, you will learn about HTTP and how its protected by use of HTTPS. Also, how important it’s to secure your browsers to avoid getting viruses and getting hacked. 
# Internet Architecture

## Internet Protocol
* What is an IP address and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6? 

  IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to computer network that uses the IP protocol for communication. IPv4 is an IP version widely used to identify devices on a network using an addressing system. It uses a 32-bit address scheme to store 2^32 addresses which is more than 4 billion addresses. It carries 94% of Internet traffic and has been around since 1983. IPv6 is the most recent version of the IP. This one has 128-bit address space and allows 340 undecillion unique address space. Its also known IPng (Internet Protocol next generation).
* Find the IP address of your computer by typing ipconfig at the command prompt (refer back to the "Operating Systems" module for details.) 
  Take a screenshot of the command without including the IP address to show your success, name the file ipconfig and upload to the lab folder on GitHub. 
* What is ICANN and how do they contribute to the global Internet? 

   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is an internationally organized, non-profit corporation that has responsibility for Internet Protocol (IP) address space allocation, protocol identifier assignment, generic (gTLD) and country code (ccTLD) Top-Level Domain name system management, and root server system management functions. ICANN is responsible for coordinating the management of the technical elements of the DNS to ensure universal resolvability so that all users of the Internet can find all valid addresses. It does this by overseeing the distribution of unique technical identifiers used in the Internet's operations, and delegation of Top-Level Domain names (such as .com, .info, etc.).
## TCP/IP

#### Review the first article and answer these questions:
* What is the responsibility of TCP/IP? 

  TCP is the component that collects and reassembles the packets of data, while IP is responsible for making sure the packets are sent to the right destination.
The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet. 

* Explain how the client-server model applies to TCP/IP. 

  The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet. The client server relationship communicates in a request–response messaging pattern and must adhere to a common communications protocol, which formally defines the rules, language, and dialog patterns to be used. Client-server communication typically adheres to the TCP/IP protocol suite. Client requests are organized and prioritized in a scheduling system, which helps servers cope in the instance of receiving requests from many distinct clients in a short space of time. The client-server approach enables any general-purpose computer to expand its capabilities by utilizing the shared resources of other hosts. Popular client-server applications include email, the World Wide Web, and network printing.

#### Review the second article and answer these questions:
Review the section of the article aligning the post office with protocol stacks.  
* Why are layers important to changing technology? 

  Each level of the stack performs a particular function and communicates with the levels above and below it.
This layered arrangement is not confined to networking, and how it works is probably best understood if you compare it to real life example.
* What types of applications run on the "application" layer?

   A few examples of application layer protocols are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).  

# Internet Security
#### Watch the video and answer these questions:
* What is HTTP and how does it support the client-server model? 

  The HTTP is the Web’s application layer protocol works on the Client-Server technology. The client request for the HTML pages towards server and the server responses with HTML pages. In this, the client requests pages and objects through its agent and Server responses them with the requested objects by displaying. Each individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer called the response. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called proxies, which perform different operations and act as gateways.
* Explain the protocols that secure HTTP uses to protect data.  

Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.

#### Review the following article: Securing Your Web Browser 
* Why should you secure your browser? 

  Not securing your web browser can lead quickly to a variety of computer problems caused by anything from spyware being installed without your knowledge to intruders taking control of your computer.
* Explain one of the risks described in the article. 

  Cookies can be used to uniquely identify visitors of a website, which some people consider a violation of privacy. If a website uses cookies for authentication, then an attacker may be able to acquire unauthorized access to that site by obtaining the cookie. Persistent cookies pose a higher risk than session cookies because they remain on the computer longer.
 
# Conclusion
Include your conclusion here...
  I learned about how important it is to secure your browser. It was interesting to know what cookies because I have seen them but I wasn't actually sure what it was. I also learned the difference between HTTP and HTTPs.
