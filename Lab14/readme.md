# Executive Summary
Goal of the lab is to reflect on the group project and disscuss about the concept and any difficulties faced. Lastly, write a small program for practice. 

# Object Oriented Programming
* Create a class (using paper and pencil or using the Microsoft whiteboard app) for the following:
a) Phone
b) House
c) Employee
* Identify the features (In the video for the Car class, we identified the properties as Year, Make Model etc)
* Identify the actions (In the video for the Car class, we identified the methods as Drive, Park, Start etc)
* Then upload a screenshot of your diagram to github for each of the above classes.

# Research Project
* Explain in 2 lines about your research project. Then answer each of the below questions.

  Our project was on Robotics and AI. Robotics and AI are different from each other by that one requires intelligence while the other one will do repeated tasks after being programmed to do so without further input. 
* How did you find your sources? What are sources that you should avoid when doing good research?

  I found my source through google. I just looked for sources with .org and .edu and other besides wiki and .com and any biased articles. 
* What did you find most useful about doing this project? What did you learn?

  Most useful thing I learned was the difference between the two and how programming plays a role in this. I always thought this was all for engineers but now I know better. 
* What was the hardest part of doing this project?

The hardes part was working with others online without seeing them in person. 
* If a team member did not co-operate or had a different idea than yours, explain how you worked with that team member.

All team members did their part and gave no problem. 

# Conclusion
I learned about programming and writing a class, features, actions, and methods.
