# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

## Hexadecimal color representation
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/ 

 In a RGB color space, hex #ab00ff is composed of 67.1% red, 0% green and 100% blue. Whereas in a CMYK color space, it is composed of 32.9% cyan, 100% magenta, 0% yellow and 0% black. It looks purple. 
* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered. 

Yea it's not appropriate color for texts. Its very bright purple. I would use more blacks n grey. I would use other dark colors like royal blue to add color to the website. 
## Logic Gates and circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate. 

  Truth table is you put the input in and see if out put is 0 or 1. 0 is false while 1 is true. There are different logic gates with a set rule for it to be either true or false. For NAND gates, true would be when one or more but not all are false, if all are true, then it's false. Remember true is 1 and false is 0.
  
* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate? 

AND gate is opposite the output of AND gate is true only when all inputs are true, if one or more of an AND gates input are false, then the output of the AND gate is false
* Complete the logic gate exercises word doc and upload to this folder.

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design
