# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?
Latency is the amount of time it takes for the desired sector of a to rotate under the read-write heads of the disk drive. Transfer time is the time it takes to transmit or move data from one place to another. It varies on rotaitonal speed of the disk.The faster a disk rotates the faster it reads the data.

* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?
Solid State Drive uses solid memory to store data. SSDs are faster to start up, faster to shut down, and faster to transfer data. It doesn't have a fan and stores data on instantly accessible memory chips. 
* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?
The faster the RAM, the faster the processing speed. With faster RAM, you increase the speed at which memory transfers info to other components, making computer more efficient. 
* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?
32 bit can access 2^32 or 4 GB of RAM , it can acces >4gb as well. While 64 bit 2^64 can access >4GB RAM it's faster.
## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU.
ALU is a digital circuit used to perform such arithmetic and logic calculations such as addition, subtraction, logical , and , or. It represents the building block of CPU. The countol unit tells the ALU what operation to perform on that data and the ALU stores the result in an output register. The control unit moves the data between these registers, the ALU, and the memory. 

## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output
The video uses an example of typing a letter B and having it displayed on a screen. First, you type B the input CPU converts it to binary. CPU requests instructions from memory to display B in pixels. CPU follows those instructions and displays B in pixels. 
# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers 
Decimal uses base of 10, group by 10 and power of 10. Binary uses base, group and power 0f 2. Hexadecimal uses base, group, and power of 16. It uses 0-9, letters A-F.
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file)
* Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work)
* Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work)
